/**
 * node — admin audit workflow (ND-E2E-003 / ND-E2E-004).
 *
 * These two cases require an ADMIN approver: publishing an application is
 * gated on an *approved* audit (node `hasApprovedAudit`), and approval only
 * happens through `/api/v1/admin/audits/:uid/approve`, which is restricted to
 * admin principals (vault `ADMIN_DIDS` / `USER_ROLE_OWNER`).
 *
 * In this environment no admin credential is available: the configured wallet
 * reports `isAdmin: false` and every `/api/v1/admin/*` route returns 403, and
 * a throwaway wallet is provisioned as a plain USER_ROLE_NORMAL. There is
 * therefore no way to drive an audit to "approved" and exercise the positive
 * publish path without fabricating a green result.
 *
 * Per the test plan these are skipped cleanly rather than faked. The inverse
 * boundary — an un-approved application cannot be published (403 "Audit not
 * approved") — IS covered and runnable in `app-write-api.spec.ts` (ND-API-022).
